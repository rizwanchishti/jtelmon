"mvn wildfly:deploy"

Deploying the EJB application
As it is, you should be able to package your EJB project by issuing the following Maven
goal and starting a command-line prompt from your project root:
mvn package
The preceding command will compile and package the application that needs to be copied
into the deployments folder of your application server. This is fine; however, we can
expect lots more from Maven by installing just a couple of plugins. In our case, we will
configure our project to use Maven’s WildFly plugin by adding the following section:
<build>
<finalName>${project.artifactId}</finalName>
<plugins>
<!— WildFly plugin to deploy the application —>
<plugin>
<groupId>org.wildfly.plugins</groupId>
<artifactId>wildfly-maven-plugin</artifactId>
<version>1.0.2.Final</version>
<configuration>
<filename>${project.build.finalName}.jar</filename>
</configuration>
</plugin>
<plugin>
<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
<artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
<version>3.1</version>
<configuration>
<!— enforce Java 8 —>
<source>1.8</source>
<target>1.8</target>
</configuration>
</plugin>
<plugin>
<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
<artifactId>maven-ejb-plugin</artifactId>
<version>2.3</version>
<configuration>
<ejbVersion>3.2</ejbVersion>
<!— Generate ejb-client for client project —>
<generateClient>true</generateClient>
</configuration>
</plugin>
</plugins>
</build>
In the first part of the XML fragment, we specified the project’s finalName attribute,
which will dictate the name of the packaged artifact (in our example, the project’s name
corresponds to our project’s artifact ID, so it will be named ticket-agency-ejb.jar).
The artifact ID named wildfly-maven-plugin will actually trigger the WildFly Maven
plugin that will be used to deploy our project.

So, once you have configured the WildFly plugin, your application can be deployed
automatically by entering from your project root. This can be done by typing the following
command in the console:
mvn wildfly:deploy
